A few scripts to facilitate pwsafe usage on OSX.

The idea is to have a few shortcut scripts taht retrieve the pwsafe password from 
the Mac Keychain, then using expect we can call pwsafe.

Current scripts are:
	pwlist
	pwget
	pwadd

All other operations on pwsafe need to be done as usual.

Requires expect and pwsafe to be installed.
